// 1. What is Java?
// - Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language.
// - It is used for building web, mobile, desktop, and enterprise-level applications.
// - Platform independence is achieved through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

// 2. Java Program Structure
// - Every Java program has at least one class.
// - The `main` method is the entry point where the program starts execution.

/*
 * 3. Java Syntax Basics
 * - Java is case-sensitive.
 * - Statements end with a semicolon `;`.
 * - Comments are used to explain the code:
 * - Single-line comment: // Example
 * - Multi-line comment: /* Example
 */
/*
 * 
 * // 4. Java Classes and Objects
 * // - Class: A blueprint for creating objects.
 * // - Object: An instance of a class with attributes and methods.
 * 
 * // 5. Java Keywords
 * // - Reserved words with predefined meanings, e.g., public, class, static, void.
 * // - Cannot be used as variable or method names.
 * 
 * // 6. Java Data Types
 * // - Primitive types: int, char, float, boolean, etc.
 * // - Non-primitive types: Arrays, Strings, Classes, etc.
 */

/*
 * 8. How Java Works
 * - Write Code: Save code in a `.java` file.
 * - Compile: Use `javac` to compile the code into a `.class` file.
 * - Run: Use `java` to execute the bytecode on the JVM.
 *
 * 9. Tools for Writing Java Code
 * - VS Code: A lightweight editor with Java support via extensions.
 * - Java Extension Pack: Provides features like IntelliSense, debugging, and
 * running Java programs.
