# Learn_Java

Welcome to **Learn_Java**! ðŸŒ±

In this repository, I'm documenting my personal journey of learning Java from scratch. This is not a teaching repository, but rather a collection of my day-by-day learning process, starting from the very basics and progressing to more advanced concepts. 

### What You Can Expect:
- Daily learning progress, including new concepts and code snippets.
- Personal projects and mini-programs built along the way to reinforce my understanding of Java.
- A step-by-step approach to mastering Java, starting from variables, data types to object-oriented programming and many more.

### Why I Created This Repo:
I created this repository as a personal log to track my growth as I dive into Java. It serves as a way to stay motivated and measure progress over time. 

Feel free to explore, but please note that this repository is meant for my learning, and not as a tutorial or teaching resource. ðŸ˜Š

### Let's Learn Java Together!
