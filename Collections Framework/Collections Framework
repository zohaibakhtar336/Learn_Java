// The Java Collections Framework is a unified architecture for storing and manipulating groups of objects.

/*
    Key components of the Collections Framework:
    1. Interfaces: Define the basic operations to be implemented by collection classes.
    2. Classes: Provide concrete implementations of the interfaces.
    3. Algorithms: Operations (like sorting, searching) that can be applied to collections.
    4. Utility Classes: Helper classes providing methods for working with collections.
*/

// 1. Interfaces
/*
    - Collection Interface: The root interface for most collection classes. Defines basic operations 
      like add, remove, contains, and size.
    
    - List Interface: An ordered collection that may contain duplicate elements. Provides operations 
      to access elements by their index.
    
    - Set Interface: A collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Common implementations 
      include HashSet and TreeSet.
    
    - Queue Interface: Represents a collection used to hold elements prior to processing. Often used in 
      scenarios like task scheduling.
    
    - Deque Interface: A double-ended queue, which allows elements to be added or removed from both ends.
    
    - Map Interface: Represents a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique. It does not 
      extend Collection, but is often grouped with it in the framework.
*/

// 2. Classes
/*
    - ArrayList: A resizable array implementation of the List interface. It allows random access and 
      is efficient for operations like get() and set().
    
    - LinkedList: A doubly linked list implementation of the List and Deque interfaces. It provides 
      efficient insertions and deletions but slower random access.
    
    - HashSet: Implements the Set interface, backed by a hash table. It does not allow duplicates and 
      does not maintain the order of elements.
    
    - TreeSet: A Set implementation that uses a red-black tree, which ensures elements are sorted 
      in a natural order or according to a Comparator provided.
    
    - HashMap: Implements the Map interface. It stores key-value pairs and allows efficient retrieval 
      of values based on the key. It does not guarantee order.
    
    - TreeMap: A SortedMap implementation that keeps the entries in sorted order according to their keys.
    
    - PriorityQueue: A Queue implementation where elements are processed based on priority rather than 
      their order in the queue.
    
    - ArrayDeque: A resizable array implementation of the Deque interface, providing efficient operations 
      at both ends of the queue.
*/

// 3. Algorithms
/*
    - Sorting: Collections framework provides the ability to sort collections. The Collections.sort() 
      method can be used to sort lists. Maps can be sorted using comparators or natural ordering.
    
    - Searching: Collections framework provides algorithms for searching. For example, binarySearch() 
      allows efficient searching in sorted collections.
    
    - Shuffling: Collections.shuffle() randomizes the order of elements in a collection.
    
    - Reversing: Collections.reverse() reverses the order of elements in a list.
    
    - Copying: Collections.copy() copies elements from one collection to another.
*/

// 4. Utility Classes
/*
    - Collections Class: A utility class that provides static methods for working with collections. 
      It includes methods like sort(), shuffle(), reverse(), max(), min(), etc.
    
    - Arrays Class: A utility class that provides static methods for working with arrays. It can be used 
      to convert arrays into collections and vice versa.
*/

// 5. Generics and Type Safety
/*
    - Generics allow collections to store elements of a specific type, ensuring compile-time type safety. 
      For example, a List<String> can only contain String objects.
    
    - Without generics, collections could hold any type of object, potentially leading to ClassCastException 
      at runtime.
*/

// 6. Concurrent Collections
/*
    - Some collections are designed for use in multi-threaded environments and are thread-safe. These include 
      ConcurrentHashMap and CopyOnWriteArrayList.
*/

// 7. Iterators
/*
    - An iterator is an object that allows you to traverse through a collection one element at a time.
    
    - The Collection interface provides the iterator() method, which returns an iterator object.
    
    - ListIterator allows bi-directional iteration and can modify elements in the collection.
    
    - Iterators allow safe traversal by preventing concurrent modification during iteration.
*/

// 8. Performance Considerations
/*
    - Different collections have different performance characteristics. For example, ArrayList provides 
      fast random access, while LinkedList is better for insertions and deletions.
    
    - Choosing the right collection depends on the use case, such as the need for fast access, ordered data, 
      or uniqueness of elements.
*/

// 9. Collections and Memory Management
/*
    - The collections framework offers memory-efficient implementations like WeakHashMap and IdentityHashMap, 
      which are designed for specific memory management needs.
