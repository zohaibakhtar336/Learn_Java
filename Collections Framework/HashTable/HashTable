/*
 * The Hashtable class is a part of the Java Collections Framework and implements
 * the Map interface. It represents a collection of key-value pairs where each 
 * key is unique, and each key is mapped to exactly one value. A Hashtable is 
 * similar to HashMap, but with some important differences in terms of synchronization 
 * and null values.
 * 
 * 1. Structure:
 * - A Hashtable is implemented as an array of buckets, with each bucket storing
 *   linked lists of key-value pairs. The key-value pairs are hashed, and the 
 *   hash code of the key determines which bucket the pair is placed into.
 * 
 * 2. Synchronization:
 * - Unlike HashMap, Hashtable is synchronized, meaning that it is thread-safe 
 *   by default. Multiple threads can access a Hashtable concurrently without 
 *   causing inconsistency, as synchronized methods prevent concurrent modification 
 *   of the Hashtable. However, this synchronization comes with a performance overhead.
 * 
 * 3. Null Keys and Null Values:
 * - A major difference between Hashtable and HashMap is that Hashtable does not
 *   allow `null` as either a key or a value. If you attempt to insert a `null`
 *   key or value, it throws a NullPointerException.
 * - On the other hand, HashMap allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.
 * 
 * 4. Performance:
 * - Due to its synchronization, Hashtable tends to have slower performance 
 *   compared to other collections, such as HashMap, in a multi-threaded environment.
 * - However, its thread-safety makes it suitable for legacy systems where 
 *   synchronization is required.
 * 
 * 5. Legacy:
 * - Hashtable is considered a legacy class in Java. It has been replaced by more 
 *   modern alternatives such as HashMap (non-synchronized) and ConcurrentHashMap 
 *   (for thread-safety in multi-threaded environments).
 * - Despite being part of the original version of Java, it is still used in older 
 *   applications or systems that require its behavior.
 * 
 * 6. Methods:
 * - Commonly used methods in Hashtable include:
 *    - put(K key, V value): Inserts a key-value pair into the Hashtable.
 *    - get(Object key): Returns the value associated with the specified key.
 *    - remove(Object key): Removes the key-value pair associated with the given key.
 *    - containsKey(Object key): Checks if a particular key exists in the Hashtable.
 *    - containsValue(Object value): Checks if a particular value exists in the Hashtable.
 *    - size(): Returns the number of key-value pairs in the Hashtable.
 *    - keys(): Returns an Enumeration of all the keys in the Hashtable.
 * 
 * 7. Iterator:
 * - A Hashtable provides an Enumeration for iterating over the keys and values. 
 *   The Enumeration does not guarantee fail-fast behavior, meaning it will not 
 *   throw a ConcurrentModificationException if the Hashtable is modified while iterating.
 *   However, this feature can lead to inconsistent results when accessed by multiple threads.
 * 
 * 8. Fail-Safe vs Fail-Fast:
 * - Fail-Safe: Collections such as ConcurrentHashMap, which are thread-safe,
 *   provide fail-safe iterators. A fail-safe iterator allows traversal of a collection
 *   even if the collection is modified during iteration.
 * - Fail-Fast: Hashtable, being a legacy class, is fail-fast. This means that if 
 *   a thread modifies the Hashtable while it is being iterated (outside the scope 
 *   of the iterator's methods), it will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.
 * 
 * 9. Thread Safety and ConcurrentHashMap:
 * - For multi-threaded applications that need a higher degree of concurrency, 
 *   a ConcurrentHashMap is preferred over a Hashtable. ConcurrentHashMap allows
 *   concurrent reads and updates to different segments of the map while maintaining 
 *   thread safety, without the performance penalty of synchronizing the entire map.
 * 
 * 10. Deprecated Methods:
 * - Some methods in Hashtable, like `elements()`, `keys()`, and `putAll()`, 
 *   are considered outdated, and using more modern alternatives (such as `keySet()` 
 *   and `values()`) is recommended.
 * 
 * Conclusion:
 * - In modern Java, it is recommended to use HashMap (if thread safety is not 
 *   a concern) or ConcurrentHashMap (if thread safety is needed). Hashtable is
 *   kept in the API for compatibility with legacy code but is not commonly used 
 *   in new applications.
